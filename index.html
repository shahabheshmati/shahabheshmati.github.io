<h2>About me</h2>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p>I received the MEng degree in <a href="http://www.mech.ntua.gr/">Mechanical Engineering</a> and the MSc degree in <a href="http://dpms-as.mech.ntua.gr/">Automatic Control Systems and Robotics</a> both from <a href="http://www.ntua.gr/index_en.html">National Technical University of Athens (NTUA)</a> in 2010 and 2012 respectively. In 2018, I received my PhD degree in Mechanical Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), Greece. </p>
<p>From January 2019 to June 2020, I held a postdoctoral position at the Decision and Control Systems, School of Electrical Engineering, KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden where I was collaborating with Prof. <a href="http://people.kth.se/~dimos/">Dimos Dimarogonas</a>.</p>
<p>From June 2020 to May 2021 I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Chair of Information-oriented Control, TUM Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Technical University of Munich, Germany collaborating with Prof. <a href="https://www.ei.tum.de/en/itr/hirche/">Sandra Hirche</a>.</p>
<p>Since May 2021, I am an assistant professor at the Department of Electronic Systems, The Technical Faculty of IT and Design, Aalborg University, Denmark.</p>
