<h2>About me</h2>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p>I received the MEng degree in <a href="http://www.mech.ntua.gr/">Mechanical Engineering</a> and the MSc degree in <a href="http://dpms-as.mech.ntua.gr/">Automatic Control Systems and Robotics</a> both from <a href="http://www.ntua.gr/index_en.html">National Technical University of Athens (NTUA)</a> in 2010 and 2012 respectively. In 2018, I received my PhD degree in Mechanical Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), Greece. My <a href="Heshmati_PhDthesis.pdf">PhD dissertation</a> title is &lsquo;&lsquo;Interaction and cooperative control for underwater robotic vehicles&rsquo;&rsquo;. In this dissertation we addressed the problem of robust control for underwater robotic vehicles under resource constraints and inspired by practical applications in the field of marine robotics. The ultimate objective of this dissertation lies in the development and implementation of efficient control strategies for autonomous single and multiple underwater robotic systems considering significant issues such as: external disturbances, limited power resources, strict communication constraints along with underwater sensing and localization issues. Specifically, we focused on cooperative and interaction control methodologies for single and multiple Underwater Vehicle Manipulator Systems (UVMSs) considering the aforementioned limitations, a topic of utmost challenging area of robotics.</p>
